# Data-Augmentation-and-Model-Performances

In this project, we explored the problem of data augmentation and its eﬀect on model performances.The idea behind our approach is to somehow create a novel technique which would leverage the data between two dissimilar datasets and help us to increase the classiﬁcation performance of a model on each individual dataset. The approach was tried and tested on two datasets related to the problem of Heart Disease Risk Detection. Extensive data augmentation evaluation, feature selection and comparative model performance analysis led to the conclusion that our novel approach increases the performance of Random Forest Classiﬁer signiﬁcantly compared to the baseline in terms of the Area Under the Curve (AUC) metric as well as the Classiﬁcation Accuracy.


1 - The run1.py file executes the script for data augmentation and Model Performance of Random Forests using the technique.

2 - cardio_train and heart are the two datasets which are used for this project.

3 - Paper.pdf is the report of the project and includes the methodlogy, results and the conclusion using this framework.
